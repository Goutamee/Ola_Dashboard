**Ola Dashboard**

1. Project Headline

Ola Ride Analytics Dashboard – Booking & Operations Performance Analysis | July 2024

 2. Purpose

This project delivers a full-stack data analytics solution for Ola's ride-booking operations, combining SQL-based data extraction and Power BI visualization. Built on over 103,000 booking records, it helps operations and business teams monitor booking success rates, analyze cancellation patterns, evaluate driver and customer ratings, track revenue, and identify incomplete ride reasons — enabling smarter decisions across fleet management, customer experience, and service quality.

3. Key Technologies Used

- Microsoft Power BI Desktop — interactive dashboard and visual analytics (`.pbix`)
- MySQL — database creation, querying, and View-based data preparation (`.sql`)
- Microsoft Excel — raw data source and staging layer (`.xlsx` with 103K+ records)
- SQL Views — reusable query logic for KPIs (10 views built: successful bookings, cancellations, ratings, revenue, etc.)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) — calculated measures and KPIs within Power BI
- Power Query (M Language) — data transformation and loading inside Power BI
